[Step-By-Step-Guide](Readme_Guides/Transfer_Scripts_Into_Netbeans_Project.md) <br>

6. **Configure Project** <br>

[Step-By-Step-Guide](Readme_Guides/Setup_Project_Configurations.md) <br>

[Step-By-Step-Guide](Readme_Guides/Use.md) <br>

8. **WHY!?** <br>
Overview: Why is doing all of this worthwhile? <br>
Reasons: 
  * Because IDE. Refactor-Rename. Find Usages. Navigate->Declaration. Hard things to do intelligently in, say, emacs. <br>
  * Regression Testing. Write your driver in such a way that you eval each test you passed in the past each time you run. Know immediately when a change makes them fail. <br>
  * (Eventually) Deployment. Currently planned to copy and zip project files as specified at the press of a button. <br>
  * You become to PLP what this guy is to long distance racing... <br>
